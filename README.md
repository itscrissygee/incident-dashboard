# Incident Analysis Dashboard Documentation

## Project Overview

Created a comprehensive dashboard to monitor and analyze incident reporting performance across multiple shifts and analysts. The dashboard focuses on key metrics including Click-Through Rate (CTR), accuracy scores, and response times.

## Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Performance Metrics

- **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: Target range 75-85%
- **Accuracy Score**: Tracking title, body, and address accuracy
- **Response Time**: Average time to process incidents
- **Critical Incidents**: High-priority situation monitoring

### 2. Interactive Filtering

- Time frame selection (Day/Week/Month)
- Shift-based filtering (Morning/Afternoon/Overnight)
- Real-time data updates

### 3. Performance Analysis

- Individual analyst performance tracking
- Comparative metrics across shifts
- Top performer recognition
- Quality score tracking

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure

```javascript
{
  shift: string,
  incidents_processed: number,
  title_accuracy: number,
  body_relevance: number,
  address_accuracy: number,
  click_through_rate: number,
  response_time: number,
  critical_incidents: number
}
```

### Visualization Choices

1. **Line Charts**: Used for tracking trends over time

   - Allows easy comparison of multiple metrics
   - Shows patterns across shifts

2. **Bar Charts**: Used for analyst performance

   - Easy comparison across team members
   - Multiple metrics per analyst
   - Clear visualization of top performers

3. **Metric Cards**: Key performance indicators
   - Quick view of critical metrics
   - Trend indicators
   - Comparison with previous periods

## User Experience Considerations

1. **Information Hierarchy**

   - Most important metrics displayed prominently
   - Logical grouping of related metrics
   - Clear visual separation of different data types

2. **Interactive Elements**

   - Intuitive filtering options
   - Responsive design
   - Tooltip information for detailed data

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Real-time updates
   - Historical comparison
   - Anomaly highlighting

## Future Enhancements

1. Add date range selection
2. Implement shift-specific KPI targets
3. Add export functionality
4. Include trend analysis
5. Add alert system for metric thresholds
